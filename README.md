# selection-mc

Monte Carlo evaluation of sample-selection estimators (Heckman two-step and OLS baselines) under distributional misspecification.

## Project structure
- `R/` functions (DGP, estimators, Monte Carlo engine, summaries, plots)
- `scripts/` runnable scripts (smoke test, full Monte Carlo, figure/table generation)
- `output/` generated results/figures/tables (not tracked except `.gitkeep`)
- `paper/` notes and write-up assets

## How to run (coming next)
1. `scripts/run_smoke_test.R`
2. `scripts/run_full_mc.R`
3. `scripts/make_tables_figs.R`
